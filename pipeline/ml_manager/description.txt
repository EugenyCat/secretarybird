How they work together

Training:
modelTrainerManager initiates the training of a new model, sets hyperparameters and passes data to the model.

After training, the model can be registered using modelRegistryManager.

Evaluation: The trained model is passed to modelEvaluatorManager for evaluation. Performance metrics can be saved or logged.

Registration and storage: After successful evaluation, the model is registered and saved using modelRegistryManager.

Deployment: If the model is approved for production, modelDeployerManager deploys the model to the required environment.
In case of problems, you can use rollback to a previous version using modelRegistryManager.


Example usage process:

Model is trained using modelTrainerManager.
Evaluation is performed through modelEvaluatorManager.
Model is registered in modelRegistryManager.
If required, the model is deployed through modelDeployerManager.

Conclusion and recommendations:

hyperparameterOptimizer.py:
This module is useful for tuning model hyperparameters.
It can be used to automate the search for the most effective parameters for a model.

ensembleOptimizer.py:
Module for combining multiple models into an ensemble.
It is useful when you need to increase accuracy by combining predictions from different models
(e.g., in stacking or bagging).

modelSelector.py:
This module helps to select the best model from a set of candidates,
based on their performance on test data.
This will help automatically determine the most effective model for the task.


General idea:
All three modules optimize different aspects of the model training process:

The first (hyperparameters) tunes parameters for each model.
The second (ensemble) combines multiple models to increase accuracy.
The third (model selection) helps to select the best model for the task.

Such separation allows you to keep your project clean and scalable,
providing flexibility in tuning and selecting models for different scenarios.




About Optimization
Approaches used in HyperparameterOptimizer (e.g., Grid Search or Random Search),
can also be applied to LSTMWithAttentionModel.
However, these methods can be very slow for neural networks, since each combination of hyperparameters requires
long model training.

Recommended optimization methods for neural networks
2. Bayesian Optimization:
Why use: This is a more intelligent approach to hyperparameter optimization.
The algorithm builds a probabilistic model that guides the selection of hyperparameters based on previous attempts,
aiming to find optimal parameters faster.
When to use: This is a good choice when model training takes significant time.
An example implementation is the Optuna or Scikit-Optimize library.

3. Hyperband:
Why use: Hyperband is an improved version of Random Search,
which dynamically allocates resources for experiments, determining early results of less
promising hyperparameters and stopping their training. This helps significantly reduce search time.
When to use: If you have many hyperparameters and need to flexibly distribute computational resources.

4. Optuna or Ray Tune:
Why use: These libraries provide high-level tools for flexible hyperparameter optimization,
including integration with neural networks and support for dynamic search.
When to use: If you want to get the ability to use advanced optimization methods with minimal effort.

How does it work together?

Models are created through the factory:
When requesting a model (e.g., lstm_attention) through ModelFactory,
an object of the corresponding model is created, for example, LSTMWithAttentionModel.

Models are registered in the registry: After creating a model, it can be registered in ModelRegistry,
so that it can later be retrieved and used for predictions.

Models are trained and used: All models have a common interface with train(), predict(), save() and load() methods,
which allows working uniformly with different types of models in your pipeline.


Summary:
The structure allows you to easily extend the system:

baseModel.py defines the interface for all models.
modelFactory.py allows creating various models.
modelRegistry.py manages all models centrally.
lstmWithAttentionModel/ contains code for the specific LSTM with Attention model.
